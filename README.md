# Python-DWG_to_PDF-AnyDWG

Additional Work Still Needed
--------------------------------------------
Add delete option variable so that if a DWG is deleted we also delete the PDF... this should be a user slectable variable as we may not always want to do this.


Installing
--------------------------------------------
1. Download <a href="https://anydwg.com/dwg2pdf/">AnyDWG</a> and install it. You NEED to install the DWG to PDF Converter Pro which includes the CLI version of the program.
2. Install Python 3.8+
3. Clone this project.
4. Run pip install -r requirements.txt


Run
--------------------------------------------
1. blah blah blah
2. more blah more blah
3. and even more blah blah blah
